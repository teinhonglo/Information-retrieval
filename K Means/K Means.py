# Function: K Means
# -------------
# K-Means is an algorithm that takes in a dataset and a constant
# k and returns k centroids (which define clusters of data in the
# dataset which are similar to one another).
def kmeans(dataSet, k):
	
    # Initialize centroids randomly
    numFeatures = dataSet.getNumFeatures()
    centroids = getRandomCentroids(numFeatures, k)
    
    # Initialize book keeping vars.
    iterations = 0
    oldCentroids = None

    while not shouldStop(oldCentroids, centroids, iterations):

        centroids = getCentroids(dataSet, labels, k)
        
    # We can get the labels too by calling getLabels(dataSet, centroids)
    return centroids

# Function: Should Stop
# -------------
# Returns True or False if k-means is done. K-means terminates either
# because it has run a maximum number of iterations OR the centroids
# stop changing.
def shouldStop(oldCentroids, centroids, iterations):
    if iterations > MAX_ITERATIONS: return True
    return oldCentroids == centroids

# Function: Get Labels
# -------------
# Returns a label for each piece of data in the dataset. 
def getLabels(dataSet, centroids):
    # For each element in the dataset, chose the closest centroid. 
    # Make that centroid the element's label.

# Function: Get Centroids
# -------------
# Returns k random centroids, each of dimension n.
def getCentroids(dataSet, labels, k):
    # Each centroid is the geometric mean of the points that
    # have that centroid's label. Important: If a centroid is empty (no points have
    # that centroid's label) you should randomly re-initialize it.
